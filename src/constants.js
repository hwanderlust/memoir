Ragnarok, directed by a Kiwi, was the perfect showing--though I didn't know it at the time. And that pause for intermission was completely startling! People made their ways to the doors and you'd assume they'll be queueing up for the loo, but many went for the traditional cookies and other baked goods being sold out front.
